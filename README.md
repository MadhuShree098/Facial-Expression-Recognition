REAL TIME EMOTION DETECTION

Abstract
Facial expressions convey non-verbal cues, playing a crucial role in interpersonal relations. The Facial Expression Recognition system aims to identify the emotional state of a person through image processing and machine learning. This system compares captured images with a trained dataset stored in a database, displaying the emotional state of the person in the image. The system utilizes the Local Binary Pattern (LBP) as a robust facial feature descriptor, labeling pixels in images to form binary numbers. The recognition performance is evaluated using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the LBP descriptor over other appearance-based feature representation methods.

Project Overview
In today's networked world, the importance of maintaining information and physical property security is growing, but so is the difficulty in achieving it. In countries like Nepal, where crime rates are escalating, the lack of automatic systems for tracking a person's activity poses a significant challenge. The Facial Expression Recognition System addresses this issue by automatically tracking facial expressions, which can aid in identifying criminals based on changes in expressions during different activities.

Project Objectives
Develop a Facial Expression Recognition System.
Implement image processing and machine learning techniques for accurate emotion identification.
Utilize the Local Binary Pattern for creating a robust facial feature descriptor.
Create a database of trained images for comparison.
Evaluate recognition performance using a Support Vector Machine.
Provide a solution for tracking a person's activity based on facial expressions.
Motivation
The inspiration for this project stems from extensive research on existing papers in the field of facial expression recognition. Analyzing various system creation methods and their accuracy and reliability, the team was highly motivated to contribute to the development of an effective system for recognizing facial expressions and tracking a person's activity.
